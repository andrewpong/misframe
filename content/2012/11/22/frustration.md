I like frustration. I like being annoyed by how things work. I like it when I find something wrong about the status quo.

Frustration is what drives me. It’s my “engine of creation.” It’s my source of inspiration. Creation isn’t just something that’s done&mdash;it’s a solution to a *problem.*

It’s easy for me to get productive. I just have to get *slightly furious.*
