Success
----
I think success is the product of work. Not *hard* work, necessarily. Just work. The rest is about two very important things: potential and opportunity.

Potential
----
I see potential all the time. Academic environments do that. There’s a continuous expansion of human capital. Amazing. For some reason, I think I forgot about my own potential. The past two years of my life have been incredible&mdash;filled with many changes, experiences, and people. I’ve grown, improved, specialized, and built up a *lot* of potential. Sometimes it just hits me&mdash;“Wow! I did that!” or “I can do this now!” The younger me would look at that and tell me, “That’s great. So what?”

> No one wants to hear about brilliance. They want to see it.

I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/preetamjinka/status/141030721467846657) that a little over a year ago. I used to think Twitter was really silly. Why would you use it? A 140-character message would be useless! Well, things changed. Sometimes, 140 characters are enough to serve as a gateway to previous emotions or states of mind. That quote takes me back to what I thought about a year ago. I see the mindset that I had back then. It’s interesting.

The point is, you can have all the potential in the world but it won’t make a difference until you utilize it. It’s time for me to *show* “brilliance.” It’s time for me to execute.

Opportunity
----
I’m in a fantastic position right now. I have an amazing job working for [Isomerous](https://isomero.us) with amazing ideas on how to move forward. I have time. I have energy. I have *potential*. Now, I have an *opportunity*. Everything seems to fit. I’m not religious and I don’t believe in fate. I think the future is a result of what has happened in the past and what occurs in the present. I have no guarantees, but that’s more interesting anyway.

*Tempus fugit.* Time to start. Let’s see what happens!
