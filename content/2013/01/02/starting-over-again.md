Alright. This is the what... third or fourth time I started over? There’s a reason why I call this blog *misframe*. I’m constantly framing (or planning) poorly and doing things wrong in general. That’s not bad, though. I love what I do. I love being annoyed at things. Seeing exactly why things don’t work convinces me better than anyone else could.

Tumblr, don’t let me down!
