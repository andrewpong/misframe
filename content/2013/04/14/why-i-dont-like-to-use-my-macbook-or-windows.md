My Thinkpad running Ubuntu 12.04 is my workhorse machine. I get most of my work done on it since my desktop is back home in Ashburn.

Here's the thing about looking at good font rendering continuously: switching to a worse display gets really annoying really quickly.

People have varying reasons why they don't use Windows or Mac OS X. I think I have a less common reason. It's not about usability or software compatibility. It's just that they both make text look like *crap*.

The following images show what I'm talking about. This is from my Macbook.

It's too chunky! I can't read chunky text all the time.

If I'm going to be reading text on a screen for the majority of a day, it better look amazing. People spend hours making each glyph of a typeface! The least we can do is see them the way they were meant to be seen.
