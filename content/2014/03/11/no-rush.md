I've just finished my first day of [Fluent 2014](https://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/).
I've talked and listened to people about jobs, careers, internships, startups,
and businesses. Also, by quick observation, I think I'm the youngest person here.
It's pretty weird when I'm in conversations where people talk about their jobs
or careers. I haven't been working that long -- I think I've worked for a grand
total of less than 2 years. I barely know what it means to have a job!

I think most people around here are ~30 years old, a decade older than me.
I'm just thinking, "do I even belong here?" Like, am I supposed to be doing
something else at this age rather than attend a conference like this? Honestly,
I can't think of anything else (other than coding) that I'd be doing.

I think it's interesting when I talk to people ~15 years older than me about
starting a business or working for/at a startup. I've started a business
and worked for at least one startup but my perspective is totally different.
This is how I got *started*. Who knows where I'll be when I'm 35? Here's
a thought: did I get a 15-year head start?

I've been thinking lately about this business idea I have. It's no secret, by
the way. I've tweeted about it several times and if you've looked at my GitHub
profile recently, you know where my mind's been lately. I think there's a market
for it, and I think I can make a business out of it. I've looked at competitors,
other projects like it, asked people about it, and so on. I got a quote from a
company that builds a project sort-of like this, and when I saw the bottom line
($4,995), I think I went "holy @!#$!" I feel like the product I envision
needs to exist. I've also been thinking about an MVP. I thought about
finding a "cofounder." Heck, I've even thought about Y Combinator and the UVa
i.Lab.

Right now, I'm thinking that I don't even want to do it. Start another business,
that is. I don't need to. I'm 20 years old. I don't need to take a huge risk,
invest a lot of time and/or money, and put in a lot of effort into something
right now. There's plenty of time for that. *There's no rush.*

So here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to start working on this thing. As
much as I can. I'm going to try to compete directly against that thing that costs $4,995 and
(drumroll please........) make it completely free and open-source. Starting
a startup can wait. I have time. I'm not out of ideas. *There's no rush.*

By the way, when I started my web hosting business, one of the thoughts that
went through my head was, "I have no job experience. Who's going to hire a
16-year-old without any experience? Maybe I should start something myself..."
