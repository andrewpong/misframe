I got a scanner recently and have started to scan documents. For example, the following are my "cheat sheets" for a STAT 3120 (Introduction to Mathematical Statistics) final exam. It was three hours of fun!

I'll be uploading more occasionally. I'm a fan of [graphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphology) so it is interesting to see how my handwriting changes.
