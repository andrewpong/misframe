It's been over three weeks since my last post? Wow. I know I've been
throwing some thoughts around in my head (and my notebook) for a while but
they're still only a paragraph long, I guess. They'll end up here eventually.

Onto the good stuff. I'm pretty sure I'm a workaholic.

> A workaholic is a person who is addicted to work. While the term generally implies that the person enjoys their work; it can also imply that they simply feel compelled to do it.

Yeah, that. Work, work, work. I'm generally always "busy" because I always have something to do.
Even if I don't have something immediately ready for me to work on,
I generally always come up with something. If you peek at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/PreetamJinka)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PreetamJinka) you'll notice that I frequently post screenshots
of whatever I'm working on.

These days, I can program for 8 hours at work and then come home and work on my personal stuff until
1 or 2 AM. And the following morning, it happens all over again. I don't feel like I get tired of it.
The only thing that's stopping me is that I run out of ideas, and at that point I need to take
a break and think.

My sister shared ["Let's Stop the Glorification of Busy"](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/guy-kawasaki/lets-stop-the-glorification-of-busy_b_5018712.html), and I have a few comments. I'll use block quotes.

> Redefine success. There's no prize for working the most hours per week or making the most money. At the end of our lives, we're all about the same amount of dust, so the question is how much joy you've brought into people's lives and how much have you made the world a better place.

Eh... this is different for everyone. And this is entirely subjective. Just... eh.

> Working harder doesn't necessarily mean better results -- in fact it can have the exact opposite effect.

Yes. Diminishing returns. Working should be efficient.

> Get more sleep. Not getting enough sleep is associated with health risks and higher stress levels. Every element of your life can be improved by getting the proper amount of sleep.

I'm not sure about this. I used to get around 5-6 hours of sleep during high school, and I didn't take any naps
until the last year or so. These days, I'm pretty sure I get around 8 hours total. It's hard to say for sure
because I'm up at odd times. Anyway, I think I was more productive in high school, and I feel the most
energized when I get less sleep. So instead of getting more sleep, I should try getting *less* sleep?
I should try it.

> Take a digital detox.

No. That is all.

> Learning shouldn't stop when you're out of school -- indeed, that's when learning may truly begin.

+1 +1 +1. A lot of the stuff I've learned and found most useful came from other people
or things that I've picked up on myself.

> I've often thought that my creativity has declined because I do not take long drives as often!

Yup. Cruisin' around is fun (especially with a motorcycle)!
