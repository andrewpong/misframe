> When no-one’s looking, when the house is empty, when the afternoon is yours alone — what you choose to do says a lot about you. Pay close attention to where your mind wanders in the shower. Your natural wanderings are your compass to what’s truly interesting to you.

I mentioned something about this before when I wrote about [thought experiments](https://misfra.me/thought-experiments).
I still do this stuff. These days, it happens mostly right before I go to sleep.

Fortunately, I'm already aware of what's "truly interesting" to me.
