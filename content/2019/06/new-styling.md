I spent a few evenings this week redesigning this site. I usually update the
HTML and CSS locally and tweak things as I go, but this time I started with
a mockup in Sketch and didn't touch the code until I had something that really
looked good. This workflow worked out great.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true" data-theme="light" data-link-color="#333"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">Hmm... ðŸ¤” <a href="https://t.co/bOTBnXUFkJ">pic.twitter.com/bOTBnXUFkJ</a></p>&mdash; preetam (@PreetamJinka) <a href="https://twitter.com/PreetamJinka/status/1139369122125369344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


Here's what changed:

* Font styling has been adjusted to look cleaner and more consistent. I thought about changing the font I used but small color and size tweaks ended up solving the issues.
* There are summaries of posts on the front page instead of lists. Smaller posts like this one show up as a whole.
* The top posts have moved to their own section.
* Comments have been removed.

Now I just have to write more ðŸ™‚.
