title: Objectives for 2020

Happy New Year! I turned 26 late last year. The nice thing about having a birthday near
the end of the year is I can plan for the next year of life with the calendar year,
and treat New Year's resolutions as age resolutions too. Here's what I have planned
for 2020.

2019 was the first year I took New Year's resolutions seriously. I wanted to

* Go to the dentist
* Get 6-pack abs
* Have meaningful conversations with as many people as possible

I achieved two, and made good progress on the third (can you guess which?).

For 2020 I decided to carry those resolutions forward and introduce the
following.

#### Be more patient, focused, and resilient.

There's a lot going on in life, and I keep getting busier and busier.
I haven't had major issues with patience, focus, or resilience, but I predict
I will have to improve these skills because life won't slow down and
I'll have even more things to manage in the future. In 2019 I read a couple
of books about managing stress and I'll be putting the techniques I learned to the test.

* [Resilient: How to Grow an Unshakable Core of Calm, Strength, and Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/Resilient-Grow-Unshakable-Strength-Happiness/dp/0451498844)

#### Write more.

> Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens.

After I moved to the Bay Area almost two years ago, I started consuming content
more than producing content. I learned a lot: about software security, more about startups,
about the Bay Area, and so on. I thought about several potential blog posts but
never prioritized writing them down mainly because I didn't fully understand the topics.
But writing is a great way to understand things! I learned that in college.

> and what it means. What I want and what I fear."  
> â€”Joan Didion

I have plenty of blog post ideas in my head and still think about new ones all the time
(especially on my 40-min commute). All I have to do is set some time aside, think
through stuff, and write. And not be afraid of being wrong.

#### Be true to myself.

I worry less about what others think as I get older, like most people. But
I still find myself holding back or doing things according to others' standards.
This year I will be pushing some boundaries, taking more risks, and will be resilient
against failures.

There are _so_ many other things I want to do in 2020, like flossing more, reading more,
getting better at small talk, but I want to focus on my three main objectives first.
Here we go!
