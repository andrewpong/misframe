I've been trying to read more. I've had a Goodreads reading challenge every year since 2017,
and my goals have been at least 12 books a year. Even though I'm more serious about reading
than ever, I'm actually reading less. It's been difficult to come up with a reading strategy
that becomes a habit.

My goal was to read a chapter a day. I read about a page a minute, and I assumed chapters
are usually around 30 pages, so that's about 30 minutes a day. I wanted those 30 minutes
to be 30 uninterrupted minutes of reading. I tried to figure out the best time of the day
to put those 30 minutes. The mornings? The evenings? Some other time while I was at work?
It was never consistent.

I rarely do something for 30 minutes without interruptions. It’s become a lot more difficult
for me lately, and it's a bad habit I can't change easily. I decided I wouldn't try to start
reading when I knew something else was on my mind and I would get interrupted. Bad idea.
There’s always something else.

That's why I was reading less than before. Then I found out about how Stephen King reads:

> I take a book with me everywhere I go, and find there are all sorts of opportunities to dip
> in. The trick is to teach yourself to read in small sips as well as in long swallows.
> Waiting rooms were made for books -- of course! But so are theater lobbies before the show,
> long and boring checkout lines, and everyone's favorite, the john.
>
> —Stephen King, _On Writing_

I was initially skeptical–can you really read a couple of pages at a time and still make
decent progress? Won't you forget what you just read by the time you get around to another
"sip" of reading? After trying it out, I learned you don't. After years of mainly reading blog
posts, tweets, emails, and Slack messages, it turns out I got used to reading little sips at a
time. And I'm pretty good at it.

My goal lately is to read in a sip of 10 minutes a day. It's an easy goal to hit. That's like
waiting for the elevator at the office, my mocha at Starbucks, lunch at the office, and a stroll
around the parking lot. It doesn't sound like much but that's already 300 pages a month, or
about 12 books a year!
