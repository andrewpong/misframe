These are all of the things I use on a daily basis. Everything listed here is a high-quality product
that I enjoy using and would recommend to others.

### Apple

I use several Apple products. I like the quality, how they work together, and how I don't have to think about them much.

* **Early 2015 13" MacBook Pro** — This is my personal laptop. I only use it at home with a **Dell P2715Q** 4K monitor and **Magic Keyboard 2**.
* **6th Gen iPad (2018)** — This is my first iPad. I used to use an **Amazon Fire 7**. This is a significant upgrade.
* **iPhone X**
* **Apple Watch Series 4**

I use the following at the office:

* **2017 15" MacBook Pro**
* **Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball**
* **KBParadise V80** — This is a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches. I got the vintage one. It looks great.

### Photography

* **Fujifilm X-T20** — I just bought this camera so I only have the Fujifilm 15-45mm XC f/3.5-5.6 lens.
* **Panasonic Lumix ZS50** — This is a tiny point-and-shoot that I can carry around in my pocket.

### Music

* **Sony WH-1000XM3** — These are the headphones I listen with the most these days. They're Bluetooth so I like being able walk around without carrying my phone or MP3 player with me.
* **Grado SR80i** — I use these open-back headphones at home when I'm working or playing guitar.
* **Massdrop x NuForce EDC In-Ear Monitors** — I always have these IEMs in my backpack. They're handy for travel and when I forget my other headphones.
* **FiiO M3** — Yes, I use an MP3 player! It's great when I want to go offline or when I'm traveling. Unfortunately it doesn't have Bluetooth and the software on it isn't great, but it stores a lot of songs and has great audio quality.
* **Gibson Les Paul Classic** — I play through a **Blackstar Fly 3** amp and a **Scarlett Solo** USB audio interface.
* **Alesis Nitro Mesh Kit** — This is my first drum kit. Still learning!
